## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Nox is a playground for OS concepts and design in Rust. The platform I am using right now 
is the Pine RockPro64 board with a RK3399 SoC and a cortex-m0 processessor on board.
## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

- Rust nightly v1.61.0


### Installing

#### [__Rust:__](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

To install rust, follow the general instructions for installing the rust toolchain above.
Once you have rust installed, you will want to make sure you are on the right compiler version, and that you are using the nightly build, since some features we use in rust are not stable yet.

```
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.61.0-nightly (e789f3a3a 2022-02-11)
```

To set the default compiler version for a single project, navigate to the project directory and run the following

```
$ rustup override set nightly
```
